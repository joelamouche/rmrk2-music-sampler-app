        For the Proof of Concept, we will be selling Music NFTs corresponding to the samples created by Billy Ray Valentines and Walfroy.
        These msuic samples will still be available for free in the future versions of the website, but the owners of these will be rewarded for their early support in different ways: price reductions on incoming collections, exclusive access, etc.
      </p>
      <h3 className="nes-text is-primary">Reward Early Participants</h3>
      <p>
        One Sample NFT will be rewarded to a random address that has reacted with an emoji on the sinlgular platform. The user will be able to chose between the samples they liked.
        Another free Sample NFT will be awarded on twitter to users who like and retweet (instructions incoming).
      </p>
      <h3 className="nes-text is-primary">Following collections</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on the success of the P.O.C. and user feedback, the idea is that for the next music drops, users will only be able to access the interface with NFT they own (except for the Alpha collection that will remain free to use).
        Also, for the next Music NFT drops, the same sample will be in multiple editions, allowing more users to use them and for a lower price.
