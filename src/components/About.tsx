      <p>This proof of concept shows the potential of composable music with nested NFTs.</p>
      <p>These samples will be on sale on the RMRK Singular platform. The standard for composable music on RMRK 2.0 is still WIP.</p>
      <p>For this Proof of Concept, I asked to electronic music artists to make 4 bars loops and decompose them by track. The idea is to provide a beginner friendly user experience.</p>

      <h3 className="nes-text is-success">Walfroy</h3>
      <p>As an active member of the mighty Union Trance Mission label, this multi-faceted french producer has been exploring many corners of the electronic sphere for several years to develop his own unidentified musical object.

Fond of rave sounds, old school techno and other forbidden trajectories, he simply draws on everything that electronic music has to offer and seems much more open to his intuitions rather than any desire to fit the mold.
This is what makes him a DJ with an overflowing energy of unpredictability, constantly trying to be the most adventurous in his mixing technique.</p>
